> I love stories, particularly stories of hard work and persistence to achieve the American Dream. Fair Oaks Cellars is a dream of changing lifestyle, a dream of moving from meeting room to meeting room coordinating efforts of a couple dozen teams over many time zones to exercising body, mind and art with grapes people and tools to produce a product that touches lives.

## Passion

Mark Bui-Ford's passion to prepare and share good food and drink started in his teens when he served a European-style apprenticeship to master French pastry chef François Gæng. His plans to earn an Enology & Viticulture graduate degree at UC Davis and professionally make wine are in answer to a call back to work that touches and lifts souls, work that can be savored and become part of shared life memories.

Jesus Christ is reported as having made some very good wine at a wedding feast in Cana. Mark knows he'll never be able to turn water into wine as fast as Jesus Christ did, but he does hope to follow in his steps making very good wine.

## Plan

Migrate professional project management skills to profitably create outstanding wine.

## Prerequisites

Our journey satisfying [prerequisite course requirements](http://vengg.ucdavis.edu/admissions/admissions/academic-preparation) for admission into the UC Davis Viticulture and Enology Graduate Group started in the the Spring, 2014 semester. Finding these courses offered in the evening has resulted in taking classes at 8 different colleges and universities.

* Spring, 2014 General Chemistry I at Cañada College
* Summer, 2014 Macroeconomics online from Foothill College
* Fall, 2014 General Chemistry II at Mission College
* Fall, 2014 Macroeconomics online from Foothill College
* Spring, 2015 Botany at College of San Mateo
* Spring, 2015 Advanced Statistics and Quantitative Methods online from UCLA
* Fall, 2015 Cellular Biology at San Jose City College

Mark's incredibly sweet & supportive husband David Bui-Ford has been struggling through all these prerequisite courses together with him. Unless they win the lottery, Mark will be the only one to enroll in the program at Davis, but it has been so wonderful to be able to share this experience and have a good study partner on this long leg of the journey.
