**To be clear, we are not a commercial winery and so have no wine to sell. This page is more to share all the fun we've been having making wine in the back yard, shed and guest bedroom of our peninsula bungalow.**

## 2015 Paso Robles Cabaret Sauvignon

This vintage gave us our first hands-on taste to the craziness of harvest season

After putting in a full day at our day jobs and attending an evening cellular biology lab at San Jose City College, we drove down to Paso Robles when our lab was over at 10:30 PM. After grabbing a few hours' sleep at our cousins' place, we met a picking crew at 6:00 AM to help pick about 3/4 ton of beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon grapes on the west side of Paso Robles.

After loading grapes in the pickup, we made a stop at the Farm Supply Company in Paso Robles to get some equipment; we ended up becoming members of the Farm Supply Company co-op.

We got the grapes back to the bungalow late afternoon and started sorting and putting all the grapes through a hand crank destemmer.

Very dear friends and family helped us handle all that fruit so by midnight it was safe and sound starting to ferment in a half ton picking bin in our guest bedroom.

The bulk of what we pressed is sitting in a standard (225 L/60 gallon) French oak barrel, where we'll probably let it age, topped off, until Summer, 2017 or so.

The guest bedroom sure smells pretty nice!

## 2016 Paso Robles Petite Sirah

Maybe we'll call this wine O'500; we drove down Friday night, got a few hours sleep and met a picking crew at 5:00 and strapped on headlamps to help pick 3/4 ton of west Paso Robles Petite Sirah.

After a breakfast at [Joe's Place](https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-place-paso-robles-paso-robles), we headed back to the bungalow to cluster sort and then use our new Enotalia ENO 15 to destem and lightly crush into a chute leading directly into the half ton picking bin we use as a fermentation vat. Over the previous month I had hand deburred and polished every one of the 249 holes in the ENO 15 basket so it would not cut tiny pieces of stem off like we saw in 2015.

Applying some industrial engineering, having a powered destemmer and having a crush crew of 9 (vs. 5 in 2015) helped us reduce sorting and destemming time by 42%. By 4:00 in the afternoon, we had the must in the fermentation vat and used our new [CoolBot](https://www.storeitcold.com/) air conditioner controller to bring the temperature down to 50ºF/10ºC to cold soak for 48 hours.

After fermentation was over, we took a quick taste, covered the must and let it sit another couple weeks at 50ºF/10ºC to pick up some more color from the skins.

Tasting notes written right at the end of fermentation:

> Beautiful deep purple to the rim. Notes of black cherry and plum overlaying a graphite core. Acids and tannin in balance. Soft on the attack but rapidly gains power and spice in the long finish. Malolactic fermentation will round out the harsh edges and oak will add complexity and character to what is shaping up to be a powerhouse wine.

We only produce one barrel, so we are using a barrel made of oak from the Allier and Vosges forests to give it some of the character of both. The barrel is medium plus toasted (so fairly dark) with untoasted heads.

We bottled, sparging with argon, after aging 14 months in barrel. This gave the wine lots of those enjoyable aromas oak barrels can contribute, but still kept that wonderful Paso Robles fruit character. Plenty of permanent pigment was formed, so the color is still nice and deep. We have been enjoying bottles with friends and family ever since it had a few weeks to settle down in the bottles!
