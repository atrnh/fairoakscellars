![Mark and David Bui-Ford](/static/img/markdave.jpg "Mark and David Bui-Ford")

**Mark and David Bui-Ford have roots in the Bay Area, Central Coast and Napa. They have Silicon Valley day jobs and take classes around the Bay Area to satisfy prerequisite course requirements for admission into the UC Davis Viticulture and Enology Graduate Group.**

Mark got to know the Central Coast while getting his undergrad degree at Cal Poly. David and Mark have been hanging out in the Central Cost together since they met in 1997; their cousins in Paso Robles see them often!

In July, 2010, Mark and David celebrated their wedding together at a Paso Robles winery with friends and family from all over California, Arizona and Germany.

Most of the Bui extended family lives in the Bay Area. Napa County is home for extended family from the Ford side of Bui-Ford.
