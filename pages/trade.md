**We have no wine to sell, but what we do have is aspiring winemaker Mark Bui-Ford, who is eager to dive in and work hard getting more experience with commercial winemaking.**

Please let Mark know if you might be able to use his help in any commercial winemaking endeavors, especially during these times over the next several years:

## 2018

Mark plans to start classes full time at the UC Davis Viticulture & Enology Graduate Group the third week of September, 2018, but would love to help out at a commercial winery before then!

# 2019

Looking for a 2018 crush intern? Mark is looking for internship opportunities as part of completing the Viticulture & Enology Professional Science Masters program at UC Davis

# 2020

When Mark wraps up at UC Davis Summer, 2020, he will be looking to learn more of the high art of winemaking from a Jedi Master Winemaker.
